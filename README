:logstore 

  - a storage engine for arbitrary data for POSIX systems with spinning hard disks
  - "puts" are efficient by use of an append-only log file for storage
  - "gets" are as fast as your disk can seek and read
  - reads to be amortized via higher-level caching
  - no caching built-in; very low memory footprint
  - thread-safe (dumb mutex; no performance loss for single-threaded apps)
  - background log compaction / garbage collection
  - entries assigned id numbers by logstore
  - extensions for Python, Node.js forthcoming
  - expected to be a basis for embedded object databases, datastore server, etc.

:installation

  make
  make test
  make bench
  sudo make install

:usage

  #include <logstore.h>

  use LDFLAGS -llogstore -pthread

  The API should be very straightforward.
