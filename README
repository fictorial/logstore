logstore 

- storage engine for arbitrary data for POSIX systems with spinning hard disks
- "puts" are efficient, "gets" are as fast as your disk can seek and read
- reads to be amortized via higher-level caching
- no caching built-in; very low memory footprint
- thread-safe (dumb mutex; no performance loss for single-threaded apps)
- background log compaction
- entries assigned id numbers by system
- extensions for Python, Node.js forthcoming
- basis for embedded object database, datastore server, etc.
- on a MacBook Pro with zero tuning: 
  - 250K 4-byte-value puts/sec. with fsync 1x/sec.
  - 250K 4-byte-value random gets/sec. 
  - 50K 1KiB-value puts/sec. with fsync 1x/sec.; 
  - 5K 1KiB-value random gets/sec.
