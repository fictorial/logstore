logstore 

- storage engine for arbitrary data for POSIX systems with spinning hard disks
- "puts" are efficient, "gets" are as fast as your disk can seek and read
- reads to be amortized via higher-level caching
- no caching built-in; very low memory footprint
- thread-safe (dumb mutex; no performance loss for single-threaded apps)
- background log compaction
- entries assigned id numbers by system
- extensions for Python, Node.js forthcoming
- basis for embedded object database, datastore server, etc.
